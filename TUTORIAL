==============================================================================

The directory containing the .pde files that make up our program must contain
two .csv files as well, named "tasks.csv" and "scoredifference.csv". The 
formatting of these files was adapted from some of the files that were 
provided to us by Ben Shapiro.

tasks.csv should be in the following format:

The first cell of the first row can really be titled anything, but we have it
titled player, as the rest that cell's column (that is, the first column) has
the names of the players of the game. The rest of the cell's in the first row
are named with a leading number (representing objective number) followed by a
task name. So, an example of this would be "2 off task Meso populates," which
means "the off task Meso populates in objective number 2." The rest of the 
column is filled with the values generated by each player for these categories.
Our sample tasks.csv is included for reference.

scoredifference.csv should have the following format:
The first column must be exactly the same as the first column in tasks.csv.
The second column consists of the pre/post score difference, so for each 
player, there must be a percentage difference between their pre and post 
scores. While the numbers are meant to represent percentages, the % character
has been left out just to make parsing a bit easier. As a note, positive and 
negative values can both be used, but the current version of our project groups
zero improvement and negative percentages as "No improvement." This could be
changed in future versions of the project.

===============================================================================
Using the program:

When the program is run, the user will notice a number of buttons drawn onto the
screen. On the right side of the screen, the user is given a visual key to
understand what information the differently displayed colors are encoding (in
this version of the project, representing player rankings in term of 
percentile), and below this key will be scroll buttons allowing the user to 
move up and down the list of players to see information about those who haven't
yet been drawn to the screen. On the bottom left of the display are buttons
to change which particular task is being viewed, and when this is done, a
number of buttons will appear, based on how many objectives contained that
particular task. Clicking on any of the objective buttons will change the view
such that the clicked objective's column of colored bars is sorted from high 
percentile to low percentile, which gives the user more control over how 
information is displayed and giving them more ways to identify patterns in
user play. The bottom right hand corner also contains four buttons, currently
labeled "51+, 50-26, 25-1, and Did not improve." When selected, these buttons
will draw dark borders around those players who improved by a percentage in that
range.
